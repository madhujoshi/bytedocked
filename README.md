# Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to setup the ByteCubed DevOps Challenge node.  The instructions are designed to meet these requirements.

 - Use a configuration management tool of your choice (i.e. Ansible,
   Chef, Puppet, etc.) to configure a Linux server as a docker host.
 - Build a container with a webserver
 - Configure https (self-signed certificate is acceptable)
 - Configure http redirect to https
 - Configure the http/https homepage to display “BYTECUBED DEVOPS
   CHALLENGE”
 - Deploy the container on the Docker host.
 - Configure host-based firewall for ports 22, 80 and 443
 - Forward ports 80 and 443 to the docker web server container.
 - Create an automated test to verify the web server is listening on
   port 443

# Tools used

 - AWS EC2 instance
 - Ansible 2.5.3 on Mac OS X
 - Docker
 - nginx
 - Github public repo for version control

# Source code
The source code (Ansible playbooks) can be found at **[ByteDocked Github Repo](https://github.com/madhujoshi/bytedocked)**

## Assumptions and setup


 - Create or choose AWS keypair to use for the instance. The example
   assumes **bytecubed-test-keypair**.  You can override the keypair by
   passing --keypair argument (details below)
 - Run ssh-agent on local laptop and add the AWS keypair you're going to use.  For instance, on a Mac OX
 '''
 ssh-agent
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/bytecubed-test-keypair
 '''
 - Choose instance type. t2.micro is used for this setup but can be overridden with --instance_type argument
 - Choose region. us-east-2 is assumed but you can pass another region with --region
 - tag your instance with --tag (default is bytecubed-test)
 - Choose an AMI for the Linux instance by passing --ami (default is Amazon Linux in us-east-2, ami-922914f7)
 - Make sure AWS credentials for CLI access is setup.  Set the environment variable AWS_PROFILE to AWS profile you chose.  The ~/.aws/credentials file defines these profiles and should look like

[bytecubed]
region = us-east-2
aws_access_key_id  = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

So, set the environment variable like:

export AWS_PROFILE=bytecubed

## Checkout Git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/madhujoshi/bytedocked
```
## Run the setup
```
cd bytedocked
ansible-playbook site.yml

If you want to override parameters, the command would be:
ansible-playbook site.yml --extra-vars "keypair=bytecubed-kp "
```

This should take about 5 minutes to complete the setup.  Finally it prints the http and https URLs.  Paste them in your browser or use curl commands as shown below (replace the ec2 DNS name):

```
curl -I http://ec2-18-191-120-50.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
curl -k https://ec2-18-191-120-50.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
```
The first command will print 301 redirect and second command will print the challenge string.
